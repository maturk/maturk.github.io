I created this website to put myself out there on the internet and to showcase some of my projects. It's meant to be an informal site composed of blog posts as well as academic projects related to my interests. Most of the things you see here come from my time as a student at ETH Zurich and during some of my travels.

I am a curious person with a lot of interests. I started my academic career at Aalto University studying Mathematics and Engineering Physics. I shortly dropped out and moved to Scotland, a life dream of mine at the time, to study Mechanical Engineering at the University of Glasgow. After I completed my Bachelor's degree, I changed fields again to Robotics. Now my main interests lie in computer vision, computer graphics, and AI. 

I am quite an ordinary person but I am really motivated to push my limits. Failure is a part of success, and I'll keep trying my best.

        <h3 align="left"><i>'No Man is an Island'</i></h3>
<pre style="background: white;word-wrap: break-word">No man is an island entire of itself; 
every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; 
if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe 
is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as 
well as any manner of thy friends or of thine own were; 

any man's death diminishes me, 
because I am involved in mankind. 

And therefore never send to know for whom 
the bell tolls; it tolls for thee. 

- John Donne
