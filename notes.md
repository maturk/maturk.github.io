<h2>Python</h2>
<b>Dictionary</b>:
- dict.setdefault(key, default=None)
- dict.get(key, default=None)
- lists cannot be keys, only immutable types can be keys to dictionaries. Could use tuple([]) to make list to tuple immutable. 

- Sets are mutable, tuples not.

<b>Strings</b>:
- Can add new letters to string with s +='let'. No append function like arrays. 


<b>Random Functions</b>:
- ord(): for unicode characters
- reversing a string: string[::-1]. Creates a copy (more memory).
